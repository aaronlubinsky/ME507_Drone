This is the documentation for a quadcopter design by Aaron Lubisnky and Dane Carroll. This project was taken on and guided by Cal Poly\textquotesingle{}s ME507 course (Graduate Mechanical Control Systems) and instructed by lecturer, Charlie Refvem.

The drone has a custom designed and 3D printed frame. It has been designed to operate using a custom PCB including an onboard STM2\+F411\+CEU6 MCU and BNO055 IMU. Though, currently uses a Blackpill development board and Bosch BN055 development board due to in house PCB manufacturing failures. The arming sequence is tailored towards Ready\+Tosky ESCs and the bluetooth module (HC05) is intended to interact with a PC running a custom python script for drone control and plotting blackboc data.\hypertarget{index_features_sec}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Key Features}{Key Features}}\label{index_features_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item PID control for roll, pitch, and yaw
\item BNO055 IMU integration
\item ESC motor control with safety limits

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Start program and observe LEDs.
\item Solid Red LED indicates that the BNO055 is calibrating. Maneuver quadcopter in figure-\/8 pattern until blinking stops LED is calibrated.
\item Use controller to begin arming sequence by pulling left joystick fully to the left. The Red LED should blink at 2Hz.
\item Connect ESCs to battery by switching both mechanical switches. The program will already be applying 100\% duty cycle. Wait for audio prompts to cycle.
\item After 4 rapid ESC beeps followed by a single beep. Hold LT on Xbox controller for 5 seconds. This lowers PWM to to complete arming sequence.
\item Once LT is released, wait for another audio prompt (3 beeps, pause, beep). Pull LT fully to the right to begin operational mode.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Follow flying instructions until flight concludes. To conclude flight, any of the safety stops will suffice. see section below.
\item If quadcopter no longer in use, unplug battery from power distribution board.

For use only with gaming controller in operational mode
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left Trigger\+: decrement thrust
\item Right Trigger\+: increment thrust
\item Left Joystick (horizontal)\+: Roll
\item Left Joystick (vertical)\+: Pitch
\item Right Joystick (horizontal)\+: decrement/increment Yaw

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Option 1\+: Push right joystick fully up on controller
\item Option 2\+: Press ENTER on Python Terminal
\item Option 3\+: Flip mechanical switches on quadcopter
\end{DoxyItemize}

All options will stop motors from spinning and dump \textquotesingle{}Blackbox\textquotesingle{} data to be analyzed through Python Script communicating with the HC05.
